## Overview

Crawdad is a library of natural language dictionaries using character-wise double-array tries.
The implementation is optimized for strings of multibyte-characters,
and you can enjoy fast text processing on strings such as Japanese or Chinese.

Experimental results can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/daac-tools/crawdad/wiki/Performance-Comparison).

### What can do

- **Key-value mapping**: Crawdad stores a set of string keys with mapping arbitrary integer values.
- **Exact match**: Crawdad supports a fast lookup for an input key.
- **Common prefix search**: Crawdad supports fast *common prefix search* that can be used to enumerate all keys appearing in a text.

### Data structures

Crawdad contains the two trie implementations:

- `crawdad::Trie` is a standard trie form that often provides the fastest queries.
- `crawdad::MpTrie` is a minimal-prefix trie form that is memory-efficient for long strings. 

## Installation

To use `crawdad`, depend on it in your Cargo manifest:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
crawdad = "0.1"
```
